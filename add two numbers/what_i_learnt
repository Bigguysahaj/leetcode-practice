Time taken = 2 hours 12 minutes

1 hour 14 minutes = struggling with the idea, relearning linked list and how to use it effectively.
58 minutes = of running and debugging.

Approach :- 
* Using the basic idea of base 10 addition, and the carrying concept/
* Utilized dummy head/(temp head) in the answer linked list for efficiency
* Used terenirary operators to fix mismatched digits
* iterating through both the list at the same time, adding each element with carried value.
* If carried, add to the sum and remove from carried
* Once done delete carried, delete dummy head and print result
